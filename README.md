## (Neo)vim

**init.vim**: heavily inspired by the basic version of https://github.com/amix/vimrc. Removed stuff I didn't need (mostly tabs) and added some stuff I like. I use https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug as plugin manager. I mostly run Windows, so change the path for vim-plug when you're not on Windows.
