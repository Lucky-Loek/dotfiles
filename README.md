## (Neo)vim

**init.vim**: heavily inspired by the basic version of https://github.com/amix/vimrc. Removed stuff I didn't need (mostly tabs) and added some stuff I like. I use https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug as plugin manager. I mostly run Windows, so change the path for vim-plug when you're not on Windows.

## Oh-My-Posh themes

**stargazing.json**: my my own oh-my-posh theme. Shows current working directory, git branch, time and execution time if a script took longer than 500 ms to run. Works best with dark terminal themes; I use [SRCERY](https://srcery-colors.github.io/).
